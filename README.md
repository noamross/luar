[![Project Status: Abandoned – Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

The goal of luar is to explore embedding of the [lua
language](https://www.lua.org) in R. It’s mostly an experiment for me to
understand wrapping C libraries.

## Installation

You can install luar from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("noamross/luar")
```

*Should* you install luar? I dunno.
